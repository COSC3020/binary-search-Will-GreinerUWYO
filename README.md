# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

Sources: I used this website for the basics of how the algorithm works. It has code, but I didn't look at it.

Asked the TA for help with the logic, the TA suggested using floor instead of -1 on my midpoint variable.
I asked Lars for help with figuring out how to make my recursive method work, and he suggested creating a new function to help me track the index value.

After bashing my head into recursion, I flipped a coin and it decided I should switch to a non-recursive method. The recursive code is in a seperate .md file
